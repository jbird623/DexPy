  desc: If one of the user's allies chose to use Grass Pledge or Water Pledge this

    user's move does nothing. If combined with Grass Pledge, the ally uses Fire Pledge
    with 150 power and a sea of fire appears on the target's side for 4 turns, which
    causes damage to non-Fire types equal to 1/8 of their maximum HP, rounded down,
    at the end of each turn during effect, including the last turn. If combined with
    Water Pledge, the ally uses Water Pledge with 150 power and a rainbow appears
    on the user's side for 4 turns, which doubles secondary effect chances and stacks
    with the Serene Grace Ability, except effects that cause flinching can only have
    their chance doubled once. When used as a combined move, this move gains STAB
    no matter what the user's type is. This move does not consume the user's Fire

    turn, and Pokemon making contact with the user lose 1/8 of their maximum HP, rounded
    down. This move has a 1/X chance of being successful, where X starts at 1 and
    triples each time this move is successfully used. X resets to 1 if this move fails,
    if the user's last move used is not Baneful Bunker, Detect, Endure, King's Shield,
    Max Guard, Obstruct, Protect, Quick Guard, Spiky Shield, or Wide Guard, or if
    it was one of those moves and the user's protection was broken. Fails if the user

    at random on each turn. On the first of the three turns, all sleeping active Pokemon
    wake up. During the three turns, no active Pokemon can fall asleep by any means,

  desc: If one of the user's allies chose to use Fire Pledge or Grass Pledge this
    turn and has not moved yet, it takes its turn immediately after the user and the
    user's move does nothing. If combined with Fire Pledge, the ally uses Water Pledge
    with 150 power and a rainbow appears on the user's side for 4 turns, which doubles
    secondary effect chances and stacks with the Serene Grace Ability, except effects
    that cause flinching can only have their chance doubled once. If combined with
    Grass Pledge, the ally uses Grass Pledge with 150 power and a swamp appears on
    the target's side for 4 turns, which quarters the Speed of each Pokemon on that
    side. When used as a combined move, this move gains STAB no matter what the user's
    type is. This move does not consume the user's Water Gem, and cannot be redirected

  desc: Causes the target to fall asleep at the end of the next turn. Fails when used
    if the target cannot fall asleep or if it already has a non-volatile status condition.
    At the end of the next turn, if the target is still active, does not have a non-volatile
    status condition, and can fall asleep, it falls asleep. If the target becomes
    affected, this effect cannot be prevented by Safeguard or a substitute, or by
    falling asleep and waking up during the effect.
